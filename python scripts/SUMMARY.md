- `../cdn.prod.website-files.com/667a2b77418bcfe1656798ef/css/gosim-website.5ee296eb6.css` → `css/gosim-website.5ee296eb6.css`
- `../cdn.prod.website-files.com/667a2b77418bcfe1656798ef/js/gosim-website.8acf7e2ee8730827676d854f89f312f7.js` → `js/gosim-website.8acf7e2ee8730827676d854f89f312f7.js`

## Missing Local Files

The following types of URLs could not be localized because they don't have corresponding local files:

### External Websites (Expected - these should remain external)
- Social media links (Twitter/X, LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.)
- External documentation and resources
- Conference websites and related links
- YouTube videos and presentations
- Scribd documents

### Missing Assets (Could potentially be downloaded)
- Some speaker profile images from a different CDN domain
- One jQuery file from CloudFront
- Some JavaScript libraries from CDN

## Script Features

### URL Detection
The script intelligently detected URLs in:
- `href` attributes in `<a>` tags
- `src` attributes in `<img>` tags
- `srcset` attributes for responsive images
- `href` attributes in `<link>` tags
- `src` attributes in `<script>` tags
- Inline styles and other attributes

### URL Mapping
The script built a comprehensive mapping system that:
- Matched CDN URLs to local files by filename
- Handled URL encoding/decoding
- Supported multiple CDN domains
- Preserved relative paths where appropriate

### File Processing
- Processed 572 HTML files efficiently
- Generated detailed reports of all changes
- Preserved file encoding and structure
- Created backup reports for review

## Benefits

1. **Improved Performance**: Local files load faster than external CDN requests
2. **Offline Functionality**: Website can work without internet connection
3. **Reduced Dependencies**: Less reliance on external services
4. **Better Control**: Full control over asset delivery and caching

## Files Generated

- `update_urls.py`: The main script
- `url_update_report.txt`: Detailed report of all changes
- `SUMMARY.md`: This summary document

## Usage

To run the script on a single file for testing:

python3 update_urls.py --test-file index.html
```

To process all files:
```bash

```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- BeautifulSoup4 library (`pip install beautifulsoup4`)

## Notes

- The script is safe and only updates URLs when local files exist
- All original files are preserved with their changes
- The script generates comprehensive reports for review
- Missing external files are clearly identified for potential future download
