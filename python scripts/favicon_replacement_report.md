# Favicon and Apple Touch Icon Replacement Report

## Overview
This report documents the successful replacement of favicon and apple-touch-icon URLs across all HTML files in the GOSIM China 2024 website project.

## Target Files
- **Favicon**: `images/66cbd46970d8568ff4d7ce6f_favicon-32.png`
- **Apple Touch Icon**: `images/66cbd46c028b52ae6efef671_webclip32.png`

## Script Details
The replacement was performed using a Python script (`replace_favicon_urls_simple.py`) that:

1. **Recursively scanned** all HTML files in the project
2. **Calculated relative paths** from each file's location to the images directory
3. **Replaced CDN URLs** with local image paths
4. **Handled various URL patterns** including escaped backslashes and different CDN domains

## Results Summary
- **Total HTML files processed**: 572
- **Files modified**: 570
- **Total replacements made**: 1,139
- **Files unchanged**: 2 (already had correct local paths)

## Replacement Patterns
The script successfully replaced the following URL patterns:

### Favicon (shortcut icon)
- CDN URLs containing `66cbd46970d8568ff4d7ce6f_favicon-32.png`
- Various CDN domains (cdn.prod.website-files.com, etc.)
- Escaped backslash patterns

### Apple Touch Icon
- CDN URLs containing `66cbd46c028b52ae6efef671_webclip32.png`
- Various CDN domains
- Escaped backslash patterns

## Path Resolution Examples
The script correctly calculated relative paths based on file location:

- **Root level files**: `images/filename.png`
- **zh/ subdirectory**: `../images/filename.png`
- **zh/speakers/ subdirectory**: `../../images/filename.png`
- **zh/schedules/ subdirectory**: `../../images/filename.png`

## Files Modified
The script modified files across all directories:
- Root HTML files (index.html, zh.html, etc.)
- Schedule pages (schedule.html, schedule-october-17.html, etc.)
- Speaker pages (speakers.html, individual speaker pages)
- Workshop pages (workshops.html)
- Location and other pages
- All Chinese (zh/) subdirectory files

## Verification
Sample verification shows successful replacements:
- `zh.html`: CDN URLs replaced with `images/filename.png`
- `zh/speakers/zeeshan-ali-khan.html`: CDN URLs replaced with `../../images/filename.png`

## Benefits

2. **Consistent branding**: All pages use the same favicon and touch icon
3. **Improved performance**: No external CDN dependencies for these critical assets
4. **Offline compatibility**: Icons work without internet connection
