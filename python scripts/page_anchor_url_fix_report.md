# Page Anchor URL Fix Report

## Summary
Successfully fixed broken URLs with page anchors across the entire website. The issue was URLs containing backslashes before hash symbols (`\#`) instead of proper hash symbols (`#`).

## Problem Description
The website had broken URLs in the format:
- **Broken**: `../index.html\#about`
- **Correct**: `../index.html#about`

This affected navigation links throughout the site, preventing proper page anchor navigation.

## Files Processed
- **Total HTML files processed**: 566
- **Files that needed fixes**: 552
- **Total URL fixes applied**: 4,436

## Fix Details
The script `fix_page_anchor_urls.py` was created to:
1. Find all HTML files recursively in the workspace
2. Search for URLs with the pattern `href="...\#..."`
3. Remove the backslash before the hash symbol
4. Save the corrected files

## Affected File Types
- Speaker pages (`speakers/*.html`)
- Schedule pages (`schedules/*.html`)
- Chinese language pages (`zh/*.html`)
- Main navigation and footer links

## Common Fixed URLs
The following URL patterns were corrected:
- `../index.html\#about` → `../index.html#about`
- `../index.html\#proposals` → `../index.html#proposals`
- `../index.html\#sponsor` → `../index.html#sponsor`
- `../index.html\#hackathon` → `../index.html#hackathon`

## Verification
After running the script:
- All 4,436 broken URLs were successfully fixed
- No remaining instances of `\.html\#` patterns found
- Navigation links now work correctly for page anchors

## Script Location
The fix script is saved as `fix_page_anchor_urls.py` in the workspace root directory for future reference.

## Impact
This fix ensures that:
- All navigation links to page sections work properly
- Users can navigate to specific sections of pages using anchor links
- The website navigation is fully functional
- No broken links remain in the site structure
