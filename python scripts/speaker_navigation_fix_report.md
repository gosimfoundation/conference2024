# Speaker Navigation URL Fix Report

## Overview
This report documents the successful fix of navigation URLs in all speaker pages within the `speakers/` and `zh/speakers/` directories.

## Problem Identified
The speaker pages contained escaped relative paths in their navigation URLs, which were causing navigation links to break. The main issues were:

1. **Escaped relative paths**: URLs like `\.\./` instead of `../`
2. **Escaped characters**: Characters like `\.html` instead of `.html`
3. **Escaped hyphens**: Characters like `\-` instead of `-`

## Files Processed
- **English speaker pages**: 132 HTML files in `speakers/` directory
- **Chinese speaker pages**: 132 HTML files in `zh/speakers/` directory
- **Total files processed**: 264 HTML files
